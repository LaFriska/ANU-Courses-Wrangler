# About

This project is a data wrangler aimed to create a clean and logical
representation for courses of the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/). Even
though much of the wrangling processes are automated, there is still a lot of manual wrangling work needed 
to format data such as course requirements and incompatibilities in a uniform, logical manner, while also
presenting special requirements, schedules, and other edge cases. Therefore, only computing courses and math courses
are wrangled. 

The aim of this project is to provide a representation for my future project: a web-based application in
ReactJS aimed to make timetabling easier for computing students of ANU, by creating an interface that
analyzes course requirements, incompatibilities, and interactive GUI. Without a consistent representation
of the data, there will be no way to accomplish that.
